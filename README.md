# Tradingbot-BTCUSDT-on-Binance

This script is a simple Python script that uses the Binance API to trade BTCUSDT. It imports the requests and json libraries, sets the API key and secret, and then uses the requests library to send a POST request to the Binance API to trade BTCUSDT. It prints the response from the API, which will contain information about the trade that was executed.

This Python script does not import the Binance library. Instead, it uses the requests library to send a POST request to the Binance API to trade BTCUSDT. The Binance API provides a way for developers to access the Binance exchange and trade cryptocurrencies programmatically, without the need for a separate library.
