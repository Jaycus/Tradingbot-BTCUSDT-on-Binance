# Tradingbot-BTCUSDT-on-Binance

This Python script does not import the Binance library. Instead, it uses the requests library to send a POST request to the Binance API to trade BTCUSDT. The Binance API provides a way for developers to access the Binance exchange and trade cryptocurrencies programmatically, without the need for a separate library.
